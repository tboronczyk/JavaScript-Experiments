Dialog is a lightweight and unobtrusive dialog widget that's easy and fun to
use!

    * Written completely in JavaScript and CSS.

    * Styling is done completely with CSS so you can easily customize your
      dialogs' appearance.

        * Confirmation
        * Information

      checkbox labeled "Don't show me this again..." for example).

    * Dialogs may be moved about with drag and drop.
